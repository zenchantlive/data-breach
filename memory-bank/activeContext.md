# Active Context - Among Us 2D Recreation

## Current Focus
We have implemented the core MVP features of our 2D recreation of Among Us using JavaScript. We now need to test, debug, and polish the game to ensure it functions correctly.

## Recent Changes
- Created the basic project structure (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Implemented the game canvas and rendering system
- Developed player movement and collision detection
- Created a simple map with rooms and corridors
- Implemented the task system
- Added impostor elimination mechanics
- Developed the meeting and voting system
- Implemented game state management and win/lose conditions

## Next Steps
1. Test the game thoroughly
   - Verify all game mechanics work as expected
   - Test edge cases and potential bugs
   - Ensure proper game flow

2. Polish the user interface
   - Improve visual feedback
   - Enhance player experience
   - Add instructions and help text

3. Add final touches
   - Implement sound effects
   - Add animations
   - Improve AI behavior

## Current Challenges
- Need to test task location assignment
- AI behavior needs refinement
- Vent usage functionality needs testing
- Sabotage functionality not yet implemented

## Notes
- The MVP is nearly complete with core functionality in place
- We've maintained a clean, modular code structure for future enhancements
- The game is playable in its current state but needs testing and refinement
