# Active Context - Among Us 2D Recreation

## Current Focus
We are currently starting the development of a 2D recreation of Among Us using JavaScript. This is the initial phase of the project where we're setting up the foundation and planning the MVP implementation.

## Recent Changes
- Created the initial memory bank structure
- Defined the product context with MVP features and future enhancements
- Established the basic project requirements

## Next Steps
1. Set up the basic project structure
   - Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
   - Set up the canvas for 2D rendering
   - Implement basic styling

2. Implement core game mechanics
   - Player movement system
   - Basic map rendering
   - Character rendering
   - Collision detection

3. Develop game loop
   - Role assignment (Crewmate/Impostor)
   - Task system
   - Impostor elimination mechanics
   - Meeting and voting system

## Current Challenges
- Determining the best approach for multiplayer functionality
- Deciding on the complexity of the initial map design
- Balancing between simplicity for MVP and extensibility for future enhancements

## Notes
- We are focusing on one MVP feature at a time
- The initial version will prioritize functionality over aesthetics
- We will use vanilla JavaScript for the MVP to minimize dependencies
