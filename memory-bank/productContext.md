# Among Us 2D Recreation - Product Context

## Project Purpose
This project aims to create a simplified 2D recreation of the popular game "Among Us" using JavaScript. The recreation will focus on delivering a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that captures the core gameplay mechanics of Among Us while maintaining simplicity for future enhancements.

## Problems Solved
- Provides a lightweight, browser-based version of Among Us
- Serves as a learning platform for game development in JavaScript
- Creates a foundation that can be incrementally improved

## How It Should Work
The game should function as a simplified version of Among Us with these core features:

### MVP Features
1. **Basic Game Loop**
   - Players can join a game session
   - Players are assigned roles (Crewmate or Impostor)
   - Crewmates complete tasks
   - Impostors try to eliminate crewmates without being detected
   - Players can call meetings to discuss and vote out suspected impostors
   - Game ends when either all impostors are eliminated or impostors outnumber crewmates

2. **Player Movement**
   - 2D top-down movement in a simple map
   - Character collision with walls and objects

3. **Tasks**
   - Simple mini-games or interactions that crewmates must complete
   - Task completion tracking

4. **Impostor Mechanics**
   - Ability to "eliminate" crewmates
   - Cooldown timer between eliminations
   - Ability to use vents for quick movement

5. **Meeting System**
   - Emergency meetings can be called
   - Voting interface to decide who to eject
   - Skip vote option

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Multiple maps
- Customizable characters
- More complex tasks
- Additional roles
- Improved graphics and animations
- Sound effects and music
- Mobile support

## Success Criteria
The MVP will be considered successful when:
1. Players can join and play a complete game loop
2. Core mechanics (movement, tasks, eliminations, meetings) function correctly
3. The game is playable in a modern web browser without significant performance issues
