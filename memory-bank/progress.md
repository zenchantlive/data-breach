# Project Progress - Among Us 2D Recreation

## Overall Status: PLANNING PHASE

We are currently in the initial planning and setup phase of the Among Us 2D recreation project. The memory bank structure has been established, and we are preparing to begin implementation of the MVP features.

## Completed Items

### Documentation
- âœ… Created product context documentation
- âœ… Established system patterns and architecture
- âœ… Defined technical context and constraints
- âœ… Set up progress tracking

### Implementation
- â¬œ *No implementation items completed yet*

## In Progress

### Current Sprint Focus
- ðŸ”„ Setting up the basic project structure
- ðŸ”„ Planning the initial game components

## Upcoming Tasks

### High Priority
1. Create basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. Set up the canvas for 2D rendering
3. Implement player movement system
4. Create simple map rendering

### Medium Priority
1. Implement character rendering
2. Add collision detection
3. Create role assignment system
4. Develop basic task system

### Low Priority
1. Design meeting and voting interface
2. Implement impostor elimination mechanics
3. Add game state transitions
4. Create win/lose conditions
