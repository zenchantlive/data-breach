### Implementation
- âœ… Created basic HTML structure
- âœ… Added CSS styling for game elements
- âœ… Implemented core JavaScript files
- âœ… Set up the canvas for 2D rendering
- âœ… Created player system (movement, rendering)
- âœ… Implemented map rendering and collision detection
- âœ… Added task system
- âœ… Created meeting and voting system
