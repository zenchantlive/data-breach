# Technical Context - Among Us 2D Recreation

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game interface
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core game logic and functionality
- **Canvas API**: 2D rendering of game elements

### Development Tools
- **Visual Studio Code**: Primary code editor
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and code repository
- **Chrome DevTools**: Debugging and performance optimization

## Development Setup

### Local Development Environment
1. **Editor Configuration**
   - ESLint for code quality
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - Live Server extension for local development

2. **Project Structure**
   - Modular file organization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Asset management system

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Manual testing for gameplay mechanics
   - Browser console for debugging
   - Cross-browser testing for compatibility

## Technical Constraints

### Browser Compatibility
- Target modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No IE11 support required
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize canvas rendering for smooth gameplay
- Minimize DOM manipulations
- Efficient asset loading and management
- Target 60 FPS on mid-range devices

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow JavaScript best practices
- Maintain consistent code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include appropriate comments and documentation

## Dependencies

### MVP Dependencies (Minimal)
- No external libraries for core functionality
- Vanilla JavaScript approach

### Potential Future Dependencies
- **Socket.io**: For multiplayer functionality
- **Howler.js**: For advanced audio management
- **Pixi.js**: For enhanced rendering capabilities (if needed)

## Deployment Strategy

### MVP Deployment
- Static site hosting (GitHub Pages)
- Manual deployment process
- Basic asset optimization

### Future Deployment Considerations
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Server component for multiplayer functionality
- CDN for asset delivery
- Database integration for game state persistence

## Technical Debt Tracking
- Maintain TODO comments for future improvements
- Document known limitations
- Track performance bottlenecks
- Plan for refactoring opportunities

## Security Considerations
- Input validation for user interactions
- Safe storage of game state
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Consideration for multiplayer security in future iterations
